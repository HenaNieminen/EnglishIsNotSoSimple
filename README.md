# English Is Not So Simple

## Hello!


Don't mind the first commits as they are only for testing purposes. This app will be converted into a
English learning app with few basic functionalities at first, but then in the future, may have some extra features
to show how ridiculous English can be at times. (If I can get that far)

### Render service

## What will be implemented for release 1?
Basic backend and functionality will hopefully be implemented by release 1. It will start out very basic and will be expanded
upon before release 2.

UI will be limited or nonexistant in Release 1 as I have two projects to make at the same time. I promise backend will be in "some state."

## For release 2?
Basic UI. Getting the first task types done (Open translation).

This release may not have persistant settings or user added content. I have an idea to use localStorage to then push the
user added words and translations into the database when it loads up into the ram, but we'll see how this pans out

## For final release?
This whole thing will hopefully be completely done! Up to a satisfactory level or maybe beyond that if I progress well.

## Screencast
Coming soon. Streamable will most likely be platform of choice (Unless objections are given). Link will be posted in this section
of the readme.
