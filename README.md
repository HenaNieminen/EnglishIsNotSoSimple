# English Is Not So Simple (Working title)



## Hello!


Don't mind the first commits as they are only for testing purposes. This app will be converted into a
English learning app with few basic functionalities at first, but then in the future, may have some extra features
to show how ridiculous English can be at times.

### Ignore the current render service

I will probably make a new Render instance since it will now start screwing up all around once I started shuffling things
around and will hit into build errors. Also the URL will definitely not match anymore. (LocationsReact as opposed to EnglishIsNotThatSimple)
