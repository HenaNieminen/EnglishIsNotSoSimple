# English Is Not So Simple (Working title)



## Hello!


Don't mind the first commits as they are only for testing purposes. This app will be converted into a
English learning app with few basic functionalities at first, but then in the future, may have some extra features
to show how ridiculous English can be at times. (If I can get that far)

### Ignore the current render service

I will probably make a new Render instance since it will now start screwing up all around once I started shuffling things
around and will hit into build errors. Also the URL will definitely not match anymore (LocationsReact as opposed to EnglishIsNotThatSimple).

## What will be implemented for release 1?
Basic backend and functionality will hopefully be implemented by release 1. It will start out very basic and will be expanded
upon before release 2.

UI will be limited on the frontend side and hopefully the first task type of typing in the correct translation of a word will
be available on release 1.

## For release 2?
More task types, better backend. More details will be updated.

Idea would be to make flashcards or such Ã  la Quizlet, but we will see how this project will advance. (At least satisfactory grade of 2 is what
I am aiming for)

## For final release?
This whole thing will hopefully be completely done! Up to a satisfactory level or maybe beyond that if I progress well.

## Screencast
Coming soon. Streamable will most likely be platform of choice (Unless objections are given). Link will be posted in this section
of the readme.
