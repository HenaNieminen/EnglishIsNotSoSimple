English Is Not So Simple allows parents to create their own Finnish to English exam for their kids!

## Features:

-Ability to edit the words and translations!

## What is this?

This is a school project for a backend course where we had to a fullstack program to teach English vocabulary to Finnish kids. More features were planned, but they were scrapped as deadlines and other personal stuff came into the way, but
still got very respectable marks and the project stayed in an acceptable scope. Some day, I could just come back here and do something new just to try and expand my
skills with React or Node.

Final grade for this project was 4/5.
